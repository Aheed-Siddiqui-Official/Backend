# 🧠 Backend

Welcome to my **Backend Learning Journey** repository! 🚀  
This repo contains all the projects, practice files, and experiments I create while learning **backend development** — from the basics to advanced concepts.  

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here
- Core backend concepts (servers, APIs, databases, authentication, etc.)  
- Practice projects and code snippets  
- Mini projects using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**  
- Notes, examples, and experiments to track my progress  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js)  
- **Frameworks:** Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Mongoose  
- **Other Tools:** Postman, VS Code, Git  

## 🎯 Goal
To master backend development step-by-step and build a solid foundation for **MERN stack** and **full-stack web development**.

## 💡 Future Plans
As I progress, I’ll be adding:
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth)  
- RESTful APIs  
- Middleware and error handling  
- Deployment setups
